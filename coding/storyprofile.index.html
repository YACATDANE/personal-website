    <h1>STARVERSE BACKSTORY TO PRESENT</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time in a multiverse not so far away existed the Tree of Life, Nim knew she needed a successor to pass it on which is why she had created two souls that would manage the balance of the universe. She wanted to make them human but the vessel was too strong to manage it, she then made a copy of a "sans" and plastered the two souls which made Night and Dream. They were given the duty of managing the blanace between Positivity and Negativity. The villagers were suspicious of Nightmare because he was the Guardian of Negativity, which was one of the scariest things to handle there. They grew to bully him and abuse him, he wanted to kill himself from this tragedy. Did Dream ever suspect this? No, because he was too blinded by the appreciation of others and the ever growing validation he gets from people. Dream loved his brother, but he never noticed the damage the villagers have done. Nightmare slowly hates Dream from how blinded he was. That's when MD and Dawn come into the story.
    </p>
    <p>It was a bright sunny day, the princess-Dawn decided she should sneak out of the castle to play by herself. She looked around the hallway and tiptoed out a secret exit she found out months ago, running across the grass with a wide smile on her face. A loud yell was heard from the north, she took suspicion of this and ran out of curiosity. She then saw the guardian of negativity being beaten up against his will by a bunch of villagers, her anger fueled and decided to defend the poor skeleton which drove the villagers away. Night looked at her in awe and shock, how could a princess-THE princess of the Moonbow family, possibly protect the most hated person in the entire village? It was a shocker, really. She faced him with a cheeky grin as she wiped the blood off her nose, holding his hand out and asked if he was okay. Goodness Night was amazed by this girl, although they just met it still made him feel...special. Dawn introduced herself and chatted while wrapping him up with first aid, she was a blabbermouth that's for sure but that didn't bother Night if he tried. In fact, he was amazed and lost in thought about her bravery.
    </p>
    <p>As time passed by, their bond grew wide. They'd visit each other more often, lending each other gifts and such. It was any normal day, she wanted to sneak out again and ran to the secret exit. Unfortunately, some guards began to chase after her to bring her back in the castle. She began to run as fast as she could to get away from them, suddenly she feels a hand grab her by the wrist and covers her mouth. She tried to yell but she was shushed by the mysterious kid who hid her away and as the guards began to search somewhere far, the kid softens her grip and lets Dawn go. She was confused, thankful yet weirded out. She looked at the kid and asked what her name was in which it was "Midnight", Dawn thanked Midnight and asked if she had a nickname but Midnight shook her head since obviously she's never thought of one. Dawn began to be in deep thought and immediately blurted out "MD". A short yet cute nickname for the girl, Midnight liked the sound of it and nodded, they both started chatting about their experiences while walking to where Night will usually be. As they got there, Night was yet again bullied and beaten. They rushed to his side and took care of him, MD was furious about what they had done and wants to hunt them down but Night tells her to leave it alone since it'll only makes things worse if this continues. Dawn retorts that even if they do fight or not, it'll still keep going so she insists to protect him when they can.
    </p>
    <p>Their bond grew stronger as they spend time with each other, ranting about their problems and favorite things to do. It was noticeable that Dawn and Night had a wholesome chemistry that was blinded by "it's only platonic!" when it definitely wasn't. In the sidelines, MD watched as their relationship grew. She was secretly jealous of them, because how can they have such a beautiful "friendship" and she's in the corner wishing it was her. Aside that, Dream used to be MD's friend but due to a massive argument on who to trust she ended the friendship with a grudge in her heart. It was then Dream and Night's 16th birthday-December 21, XXXX. Near Christmas too but the whole village celebrated it like it was the actual Christmas holiday from the amount of gifts and decorations, MD and Dawn attended the party but the villagers were only there for Dream. They could've just made it "Dream's birthday" of they were this invested. Dawn gave her gift to Dream which he thanked with a wide smile however, MD already head to their hangout area where Night was. Dream felt a little disappointed but he knew he shouldn't since it was his fault they ended their friendship. After the gift giving to Dream, they head straight to the hangout area where they celebrate Night with a small cake and a few gifts in hopes that he'll appreciate it. Indeed he did, thanking them and getting emotional since no one's given him gifts except the two of them. They spent their time playing games, ranting, gossiping, as the sun set.
    </p>
    <p>One day, Dawn and MD sneaked out of their house as usual to meet up with Nightmare but they were met with the villagers who beat Nightmare up to pulp. Unexpectedly, MD saw her enemy that used to be her friend after that argument she has with Dream. They argued together, causing a ruckus in the town square and caused Dawn's parents and MD's dad to be called out to prevent the massive fight to continue. Queen Elizabeth-Dawn's mother, surprisingly showed up to the fight and scolded Dawn about how unlady-like it was to create fights. MD retorted with a rude sentence that caused the queen to yell at MD. MD was also slapped by Mark-MD's dad, and dragged home with a tight grip. The fight was uneven so the villagers planned to beat Nightmare up as payback, as soon as they do so... Night had the forbidden apple in his hand, threatening them that if he bit onto it they'll all die. They taunted and laughed at him since they knew he wouldn't have the guts to do it. Eventually, the apple called out his name in a whisper and taunted him to bite onto it so his power can finally reign than Dream. He took a bite and caused havoc.
    </p>
    <p>He cried out loudly, falling to the ground as the pain of the transformation got to him. A tentacle busted out of his right eye as well as tentacles in his back, destroying his physical body as well as consciousness. He wasn't himself anymore, killing everyone in his way. Dawn was notified about this and rushed to where he was, tears in her eyes wishing it wasn't true. She yelled out for Nightmare, knowing-HOPING his sense of self was still somewhat there. MD evacuated but she was trying to find where Dawn was to make sure she was safe so she made the run for it to find her and when she did, she tried forcing her away to evacuate but Dawn couldn't let her best friend to be taken by darkness. Nightmare's tentacle almost landed at Dawn when Dream jumped into action to prevent any more casualties. He told MD to run to the portal he made so they could escape, she couldn't understand why he'd want to help them even after she was rude toward him but she agreed and rushed to the portal. She had Dawn in her hands with a sad look in her eyes, trying her hardest to convince MD to go back and save Nightmare. The portal was beginning to slowly close so MD gave her, her mother's necklace. The only thing that reminded MD about her mother, Dawn was shocked and tried to give it back but MD shook her head. MD said that no matter what happens, she wanted Dawn to be happy with the memories they made even if MD knew Dawn could never comprehend what she felt for her. Dawn blinked and before you knew it-MD pushed her into the portal in order to save the one she loved even if she'd never love her back, Dawn yelled out for her and cried her hardest once the portal closed. Outside the portal, MD decided to do something good for once rather than live up to the expectation of being aggressive and a war freak. Fighting alongside Dream to prevent the goop monsters wouldn't get to them, eventually Dream was struck in the heart and turned to stone which left MD to fend off the goop monsters since Nightmare went off to a different AU.
    </p>
    <p>She was stuck in the AU for centuries, wishing that Dawn had a better life. She'd hunt for food since the goop monsters were still present and sometimes would go to Dream's statue to clean him off, she'd sometimes cry silently as she brushed the vines off of him because she never got to forgive him yet he forgave her. For decades, she's survived the dead au with some living animals and fruits. After years of mental/physical torment and training, she became skilled from fighting despite the lack of resources.
    </p>
    <p>One day, she was hunting for food trying not to catch any goop monster's attention. She heard shuffling from afar and made the run for it, was it a goop monster? No. Was it an animal? No animal would stay in the vital area flooded with monsters, she began to investigate about the sound and stays in a tree. Three people? That's not possible, she's the only one who survived so she assumed it was a goop monster pretending to be a normal person. The moment they were below the tree, she pounced onto the skeleton and tried to choke them. They struggled, their friend trying to help them away from MD. A loud yell was heard, her ears perked up and stood up with the sword in hand. The moment she laid her eyes on the girl who yelled, her heart ached as her weapon was dropped to the ground. The girl was confused but nonetheless scolding her, MD couldn't believe her eyes. She took off her helmet with tired, tearful eyes as she gazed at her. The girl was even more confused, why is she crying? MD froze in place, sniffling as she called out her name. "Dawn...", The girl's ears perked, realizing this girl... It was MD! Tears flowed in her eyes as she gave MD the tightest yet affectionate hug. They both cried their heart out.
    </p>
    <p>--MD's POV--

        She was startled by Dawn's sudden hug but returned it with a tight one, the scent of her hair smelt like sweet candy, the way her hair fell smoothly reminded her of how Dawn's hair would blow on her face but loved it anyway. Oh, her touch. She missed her touch. It was nostalgic, her shorter yet chubby frame wrapped against her slender body was something she never thought she needed. She hated touch, she never enjoyed the touch of others because she felt the painful punches and aggressive behavior. But oh, the moment she met Dawn only she could touch her. Dawn's hands were surprisingly soft as a child despite the roughhousing, this made her realize that maybe some touches feel soothing and gentle like hers was, no one could replace her touch even with a lot of suitors she'll always want Dawn's.
    </p>
    <p>--DAWN'S POV--

        She rushed to MD, holding her close as her grip tightened. The memories started to sink in to her mind, missing MD's presence. She remembered MD's bravery, how she shone brighter than the sun whenever she would influence them to fight for what's right. Dawn used to think she'd make a pretty good knight from her perseverance, bravery, and justice and she was right. No one would sacrifice their life even after what they've been through and MD proved that wrong. She missed her, her best friend.
    </p>
    <p>After their reunion, they set off to get Dream and take his frozen stature to disappear. MD led them to where he was cautiously, making sure there wasn't any goop monsters nearby. As they reach the area Dawn started to perform her magic spell to eliminate Dream's stoned state, Ink and Swap-Dawn's friends, supported her while MD was on lookout if there were any goop monsters. As Dream began to lose his stone-like state, a suspicious movement appeared in front of MD and began to investigate the source of the noise without having to worry Dawn. It was quite dark so the figure wasn't evident enough and made MD's suspicion grow as she started to approach the bush with a spear in hand. The tip of her spear rearing near the bush, shifting it to the side only to find that it was a fox who ate a dead bird. She sighed in relief, facing the others only to be met with Dream's piercing gaze. It was heart-wrenching to see an old friend stare at you and look terrified after that traumatic experience of losing their brother.
