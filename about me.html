 <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
 <h3>HI! I'm the co-creator of Starverse, Dane.</h3> 
 <p>These past few months of building this website has always been a dream of mine ever since we created our au, our idea was mostly to fill in the missing spots of quarantine since we were bored and why not use this opportunity to make characters and ship them with canon ones? It started off as a rough idea of shipping ocs and gradually evolved to a more complicated au filled with sorrow, tragedy, action, teamwork, and romance. Thank goodness I chose an idea I love, or else I'd be deprived and bored. I'm just a “normal” 16yr old that decided to make an au because quarantine was boring, I draw a lot and make creative stories.</p>
 <h1>WHAT ISNPIRED ME TO MAKE THIS?</h1>
 <p>As I've said, I was bored. But if you ask in a more deeper level, we made this au due to a game called "Undertale". I was inspired by how complex and deep the meaning is despite the game only being 3 hours long if you exclude the fight scenes, as well as the fandom for creating alternate universes. The one I used was Dreamtale and it's a very beautiful backstory! Also why not make my best friend proud  by making a website over our ocs, right?</p>
 <h1>CREDITS</h1>
 <h3>SKY J. CATILO (@skadoodles12)</h3>
 <p>I would like to credit Sky J. Catilo for building this story of ours ever since the start, 4 years and going into our story you've made me realize that our roleplays, plot twists, characters made from gacha club would actually be a great use in the future. Thank you for being the greatest friend I could ask for in quarantine, I can't imagine myself without our aus.</p>
 <h3>Lenard Daniel Y.Gayo</h3>
 <p>I would also like to credit my cousin, Lenard Daniel Y. Gayo for helping me build this website piece by piece as well as giving ideas of what would fit in our aus. You're the best cousin anyone could ask for, love you kuya(bro)!</p>
 <h3>Cemee Faith Escarilla</h3>
 <p>And I'd like to thank Sir Cemee for teaching me how to make this website, showing me the basics to complicated with ease. I know I'm a stubborn student but I really do appreciate your efforts and I try very hard to pass your subject, love you sir!!</p>
