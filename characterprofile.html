        <h3>Overall Characteristics and Backstory:
        MD was quite a troublesome kid in the past, going around and messing with other kids who get in her way and not tolerating any harsh words coming from anyone elses mouth. She was cold to the core, she didnt try making friends since she thinks it only drags her down. Her father was quite problematic due to her being the cause of her mother's death which was HER birth. She did have an aquaintance once, Dream was sweet but a villager took advantage of it by making a scene and accusing MD of this mistake. Leading to the separation and caused MD to harden her core once more, eventually meeting Dawn who changed her perception in life that not all people are as bad as they seem. She became more energetic and used her attitude for the better. 
        Her father was quite a drunkard, abusing her verbally and physically. She can't deny him for whatever he does since he gives her food and shelter but it pained her to go home, it always gives her a chilling feeling once playtime with Dawn and NM are over. Her only escape was her friends, but they didn't last long when NM ate the apple and caused them to split. Changing and molding her with the ability to fight, instinct, reflex, but losing her social skills.</h3>

        <h3>Overall characteristics & backstory: 
        Dawn is a very kindhearted and gentle person, quite beautiful inside and out. But despite her well-mannered personality, she isn't afraid to stand her ground when necessary. She has the urge to help those in need, a very compassionate being. She doesn't have any attraction towards anyone at all, and she's quite confused about the topic of love.
        Centuries ago, Dawn used to live in Dreamtale as a royal with her two older brothers, distant father, and incredibly toxic mother. She knew of Dream (because he was known by almost everyone, even the royal family) but she was never able to meet him personally. One day she snuck out of the palace out of boredom, stumbling across a skeleton boy reading under the tree. Dawn wasn't familiar with Dream's brother, so she was oblivious to all the mean rumors about him. She asked what book he was reading, and the rest is history. 
        The more she spent time with Nightmare, the more she was also able to get to know Dream better. Not long after, she met a girl sitting in the rain. She had her own umbrella, so she placed it above the two of them. She asked about her name, and soon they became best friends. She introduced her to the twins and she got along with them, although not so much with Dream. The four of them were a close friend group throughout their childhood. 
        But that all changed when Nightmare was sixteen. He ate the apple, causing him to become corrupted by a vengeful spirit. Nightmare destroyed everything and everyone in his path. Dream opened a portal for Dawn and MD to escape before turning into stone statue. 
        Dawn had to learn to survive on her own, but soon as she figured out how to create her own portals with her own magic, she created one that lead to Dreamtale to check on Dream, in hopes the spell was broken. Throughout those 500 years, she'd travel across the multiverse to search for MD and Nightmare, and then back to Dreamtale to check on Dream. It was starting to get difficult to wait and search all by herself, but she made some friends along the way. (Ink and Blue, who later on became a part of the group when Dream's spell broke). Until finally, as Dawn was about to leave Dreamtale after her daily rounds, she felt a surge of magic pulse from where Dream was. They hugged and caught up and blah blah blah. Dawn introduced him to Ink and Blue and they formed a small team called the Star Sanses. (Ink and Blue joined the party!) 
        Then more years passed, MD found Dawn while she was AU hopping and recruited her as well.</h3>
